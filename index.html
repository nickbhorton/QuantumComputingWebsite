                        Quantum mechanics is a field of study in the heart of physics that deals with the fundamentally small. 
                        Unlike classical physics, quantum physics has a fully probabilistic nature. Measurements come down to 
                        a cosmic coin toss. This made physicists, like Einstein, uneasy in the 20th century. In the modern age, 
                        it has become more difficult to refute the quantum nature of the universe.</p> -->

                        The computers that run everything in the modern world are deterministic machines. 
                        They execute billions of computations per second in service of some abstract program that a human can design 
                        and interact with. This deterministic nature of computing is an essential assumption most programmers make 
                        without thinking. When designing software for human use this is a great assumption. If a keyboard was designed 
                        so that every key you entered had a 50-50 chance of being completely random, it would be unusable. In most 
                        cases the deterministic assumption is vital. However, there exist problems that, if done in a deterministic way, 
                        take exponential amounts of time. For example, you have two very big prime numbers 29,996,224,275,833 and 
                        17,680,139,794,171 and you multiply them together. Now with a computer, you want to take the resultant number 
                        and get back the large prime number factors. This process would take an eternity on a classical computer. 
                        Quantum computing is about leveraging entanglement and the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics to make 
                        tasks like finding two large prime factors doable in a human lifetime.</p> -->
